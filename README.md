# Stock Hawk

I produced this app and taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state.  I would have to find and handle error cases, add accessibliity features, allow for localization, add widgets,and add a library.

## Features

- Diagnosis the following problems (User Feedback) and improving or fixing them

## User Feedback

- Right now I can't use this app with my screen reader. My friends love it, so I would love to download it, but the buttons don't tell my screen reader what they do.
- We need to prepare Stock Hawk for the Egypt release. Make sure our translators know what to change and make sure the Arabic script will format nicely.
- Stock Hawk allows me to track the current price of stocks, but to track their prices over time, I need to use an external program. It would be wonderful if you could show more detail on a stock, including its price over time.
- I use a lot of widgets on my Android device, and I would love to have a widget that displays my stock quotes on my home screen.
- I found a bug in your app. Right now when I search for a stock quote that doesn't exist, the app crashes.
- When I opened this app for the first time without a network connection, it was a confusing blank screen. I would love a message that tells me why the screen is blank or whether my stock quotes are out of date.
